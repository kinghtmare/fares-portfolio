      <h2>About us</h2>
      <p>
        We are a team of passionate programmers with 3 years of hands-on
        experience in full-stack development. Currently in our senior year of
        high school, we have already mastered multiple technologies including
        <span class="highlight"
          >Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, React framework, MongoDB</span
        >, and have worked with <span class="highlight">Flask APIs</span> and
        <span class="highlight">Postman</span> for backend development.
      </p>

      <p>
        What excites me most about programming is the endless potential to
        create and solve problems. I thrive on building efficient systems and
        clean, functional web applications that deliver real value to users.
      </p>

      <p>
        My ambition is twofold: to become an
        <span class="highlight">elite web developer</span> crafting exceptional
        digital experiences, and to develop cybersecurity skills that could lead
        me toward <span class="highlight">ethical hacking</span>. I'm constantly
        pushing myself to work with greater efficiency and to expand my
        technical capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new technologies,
        contributing to open-source projects, or participating in coding
        competitions to sharpen my skills.

            We extend our heartfelt appreciation to our mentors for their
            insightful guidance and unwavering support in helping us reach these
            outcomes. Their expertise has been invaluable throughout this

        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>
          This project explores the design and implementation of a highly
          functional robotic system powered by an ESP32 microcontroller,
          designed to seamlessly integrate autonomous navigation and manual
          control capabilities. The robot operates in two distinct modes:
          <strong>Autonomous</strong>, where it follows a designated line on the
          ground using an array of five line-following sensors, and
          <strong>Manual</strong>, which allows for direct control through a PS4
          controller connected via Bluetooth.
        </p>

        <p>
          The implementation of a PID (Proportional, Integral, and Derivative)
          control system enables smooth and responsive navigation in
          <strong>Autonomous</strong> mode, allowing the robot to adjust its
          speed and direction based on real-time feedback from the sensors.
        </p>

        <p>
          To enhance versatility, the robot features four DC motors
          strategically selected to balance torque and speed, providing optimal
          performance under varying loads. Two servos are incorporated to
          operate a robotic arm and gripper, enabling the robot to interact with
          its environment by picking up and manipulating objects.

              <p>
                We initially selected this base; however, upon further
                assessment, we discovered that it is insufficient in size to
                accommodate the required components.
              </p>
              <p>
                The base wasn't well-balanced, so we were concerned the robot
                might tip over or end up on its back once we add the arm.

              <p>
                And then we reached to the <strong>final base</strong> this base
                represents our most successful design to date. It will be a
                two-tiered structure, and I would like to detail the placement
                of each component. The base is exceptionally stable and features
                a curved section for the infrared (IR) sensors. Additionally,
                there is a removable line at the back that can be detached if we
                encounter any difficulties with the length limitation.

                We initially focused on practicing the mechanics of gears and
                exploring how to achieve the most stable design for the gripper.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is the final result we achieved: we utilized a sphere to
                enable the gripper hand to hold the ball. The design also
                incorporates two gears that transfer the movement of the servo
                motor to the gripper's hands.
              </p>
              <p>
                We added an additional task by creating an arm that holds the
                gripper. The advantage of incorporating this arm is that, if the
                ball is dropped, the arm can lower itself to retrieve it.

                This is the final design of our arm. We also made a few
                adjustments due to limited information, but we were still able
                to achieve the best possible outcome.

        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p>
          In our software development, we initially began by implementing manual
          code and utilizing the Bluetooth module to establish a connection with
          a smartphone. However, we soon realized that this approach was too
          slow for our needs. Consequently, we considered the possibility of
          integrating a PS4 controller to enhance the control and responsiveness
          of the robot.

          <h4>PS4 Controller Library</h4>
          <p>
            The PS4Controller.h library provides an easy way to interface the
            ESP32 microcontroller with a PlayStation 4 (PS4) controller using
            Bluetooth. It allows the ESP32 to receive input from the controller,
            such as button presses, joystick movements, and sensor data, and
            provides feedback like changing the LED colors on the controller or
            triggering vibrations.

              <code>#include &lt;PS4Controller.h&gt;</code>
              <p>
                This line imports the PS4Controller.h library, which contains
                all the necessary functions to communicate with the PS4
                controller over Bluetooth.

            <div class="code-snippet">

              <code>PS4.begin("40:22:d8:75:20:22");</code>
              <p>
                The <strong>PS4.begin()</strong> function is used to initialize
                the Bluetooth communication between the ESP32 and the PS4
                controller.

              <h5>Callback Function</h5>
              <code>PS4.attach(notify);</code>
              <p>
                The <strong>PS4.attach()</strong> function allows you to assign
                a callback function that will be triggered every time the state
                of the controller changes.

          <h4>The Final Code</h4>
          <p>
            Our final code includes both autonomous mode and manual mode. In
            autonomous mode, the robot follows a designated line by interpreting
            the readings from the infrared (IR) sensors. In contrast, manual
            mode employs user-controlled commands, allowing the operator to
            navigate the robot between walls and retrieve balls to accumulate
            points in our basket.
